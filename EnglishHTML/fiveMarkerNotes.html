    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Introdution</h2>
    <p>The 5 marker, is a unique question which appears every year at the very end of the
    RUAE paper, which essentially asks you to compare the two passages given to you, and point out either the similarities or
     differences, depending on the question asked, using an appropriate quote from both passages. For example, it may ask
    "Using both passages given, identify three key areas on which they agree. You should support the points you make by referring to important ideas in both
     passages"</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>To best answer these questions, we should first read both passages thoroughly, and decide on
     a key idea they agree/disagree on(depending on the question). We should then quote two pieces of evidence for our point,
     and explain how they show their agreement/disagreement. We will then do this 3 times in total to maximise our chances for the
     full 5 marks.</p>
