    <p>In your own words questions make up a large portion of the RUAE paper, and are probably,
     the easiest marks to score during an exam. They only require a small sentence per mark, and are simple to answer correctly
    if you know what you are doing.</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>To answer an In Your Own Words question, you simply need to find a quote which links to the question
     given, and reword it in a way that it means the same thing, but include any words from the original quote. For example,
    if I had the quote "It is through embracing our imperfections that we cultivate resilience and authenticity" I could reword
    it to "By accepting our flaws we can create strength and sincerity.", and then repeat this for however many marks the question
    is worth.</p>
