      <h3 style="margin-top: 5%;">Passage 1</h3>
    <p>
      Teenagers, with their boundless energy and insatiable curiosity, yearn for independence. They crave late-night adventures, secret rendezvous, and the thrill of pushing boundaries. Yet, society grapples with the question: Should we impose curfews on our youth? This contentious issue has sparked heated debates, revealing the delicate balance between safeguarding our teens and nurturing their autonomy. 
      <br><br><br>


      Proponents argue that curfews serve as protective shields. They shield adolescents from the dark alleys of danger, the siren call of mischief, and the lurking shadows of crime. By mandating a specific time for teens to retreat indoors, we hope to shield them from harm. After all, the statistics seem to favor curfews. Nationwide, more than 80 percent of juvenile offenses take place between 9 o’clock in the morning and 10 o’clock at night, outside most curfews. The logic is clear: If we limit their nocturnal escapades, we reduce their exposure to risky situations. 
      <br><br><br>


      Moreover, curfews ostensibly foster trust between parents and teens. By adhering to these rules, adolescents demonstrate responsibility and respect. Parents, in turn, breathe easier, knowing their offspring are tucked safely in bed. It’s a pact—a silent agreement that says, I trust you, but I also worry. Curfews become the threads that weave this delicate fabric of trust. 
      <br><br><br>


      However, critics argue that curfews are stifling. They confine young souls, trapping them within the walls of conformity. Teens, they say, deserve more freedom. They yearn for moonlit walks, star-studded conversations, and the thrill of breaking curfews. Perhaps curfews, despite their noble intentions, inadvertently push teens toward rebellion. 
      <br><br><br>



      Furthermore, curfews fail to address the root causes of teen crime. Adolescents teeter on the precipice of adulthood, their wings fluttering impatiently. Shouldn’t they taste the sweet nectar of liberty? If we provided legitimate nighttime activities—safe spaces for camaraderie, creativity, and connection—perhaps curfews would lose their grip. Imagine weekends free from temporal shackles, where teens dance under the moon, their laughter echoing through the streets.  
      <br><br><br>



      In this twilight zone of choice, society grapples with its own identity. Are we guardians, shielding our fledglings from the night’s chill? Or are we mentors, guiding them toward self-discovery? The answer lies not in rigid curfews but in fostering open dialogue. Let us listen to our teens, understand their yearnings, and create spaces where safety and freedom coexist. Perhaps then, as the clock strikes midnight, our youth will find their way home—not because they must, but because they choose to. 
      <br><br><br>



      In the end, the curfew debate mirrors our collective struggle: How do we nurture without smothering? How do we protect without imprisoning? As authors of society’s narrative, we must craft a chapter that balances safety and autonomy—a chapter where curfews fade into memory, replaced by trust, understanding, and the gentle embrace of a moonlit night. Our task is not to dictate but to guide, not to confine but to empower. For in the delicate dance between curfew and freedom, our youth discover their own rhythm—a rhythm that echoes through generations, shaping the very fabric of our society. 
      </p>
      <h3>Passage 2 </h3>

    <p>
      Teenagers teeter on the precipice of adulthood, yearning for autonomy while still tethered to parental guidance. In this delicate balance, curfews emerge as a contentious issue. I contend that teen curfews, when thoughtfully implemented, serve as a necessary societal safeguard. 
      <br><br><br>



      Firstly, curfews provide structure. Adolescents, fueled by youthful exuberance, often lack the foresight to recognize danger lurking in the late hours. By mandating a specific time for them to be indoors, curfews act as a protective cocoon. They shield teens from the perils of the night—substance abuse, criminal activity, and risky behavior. As parents, we must acknowledge that our children’s judgment isn’t infallible; curfews offer a safety net. 
      <br><br><br>



      Secondly, curfews foster trust. When teens adhere to curfew regulations, they demonstrate responsibility. Trust is a reciprocal currency: parents invest it, and teens earn it. By honoring curfews, adolescents signal their reliability, paving the way for more freedom. This symbiotic relationship between trust and responsibility strengthens family bonds and prepares teens for adulthood. 
      <br><br><br>


      However, critics argue that curfews stifle individuality. They claim that teens should explore life unrestricted, akin to fledgling birds testing their wings. Yet, society isn’t a utopian aviary. It’s a complex ecosystem where rights intersect with responsibilities. Curfews don’t imprison; they guide. They teach teens that freedom isn’t absolute—it coexists with accountability. 
      <br><br><br>


      Moreover, curfews encourage community cohesion. When everyone adheres to a common rule, a sense of collective responsibility emerges. Neighbors look out for one another, fostering a safer environment. Curfews remind us that our actions ripple beyond our doorstep; they impact the entire neighborhood. 
      <br><br><br>


      In conclusion, teen curfews aren’t draconian measures; they’re societal scaffolding. By balancing freedom with responsibility, they mold responsible citizens. As we advocate for curfews, let’s remember that adolescence is fleeting, but the lessons imbibed during these formative years resonate throughout a lifetime.
