      <h3 style="margin-top: 5%;">Passage 1</h3>
    <p>
      In our modern consumer-driven world, children are not merely innocent bystanders; they are active participants in the marketplace. Marketers recognize this, and their gaze has shifted toward the youngest members of society. But what lies beneath the colorful packaging and catchy jingles? Let us delve into the multifaceted world of marketing to children, exploring both its merits and its darker implications. 
      <br><br>


      Children, with their wide-eyed wonder and insatiable curiosity, constitute a significant demographic for marketers. They wield influence over their parents’ buying decisions, and their substantial purchasing power extends beyond the candy aisle. As family sizes shrink, dual incomes rise, and parents delay having children, disposable income flows more freely. The result? An army of pint-sized consumers ready to conquer the toy store, the cereal aisle, and the latest gadget display. 
      <br><br>


      But it’s not just about immediate sales. Smart marketers recognize that children are future adult customers. These young minds develop brand loyalty and purchasing habits early on, cementing their preferences for years to come. Shaping future buyers is easier than converting adults who have already pledged allegiance to rival brands. Thus, cultivating a partnership with young consumers becomes a strategic move. 
      <br><br>


      Children under the age of 7 or 8 lack the cognitive ability to discern the persuasive intent of advertisements. To them, commercials are not sales pitches; they are unfiltered truths. The colorful cereal box promises boundless energy, and the action figure guarantees superpowers. Exploiting this innocence for profit raises many ethical questions. 
      <br><br>


      Being bombarded by ads at such a young age, children internalize these materialistic values. Possessions become markers of status and happiness. The pursuit of the next toy or gadget overshadows simpler joys like playing in the park or reading a book. What does this say about our societal priorities in the modern day? 
      <br><br>


      Furthermore we know that marketing shapes young children’s food preferences. Brightly packaged snacks and sugary drinks beckon from TV screens, playground billboards, and online games. The consequence? Rising childhood obesity rates and a generation hooked on empty calories. Are we sacrificing our children’s health at the altar of profit? 
      <br><br>


      In conclusion, marketing to children is a tightrope walk. We cannot ignore the economic realities, but we must safeguard childhood’s purity. As a society, we must ask ourselves: What legacy are we leaving for the next generation? Are we nurturing critical thinkers or grooming consumers? The answer lies not only in boardrooms but also in our collective conscience. Let us tread carefully, for the children are watching—and they deserve more than just catchy jingles and colorful packaging. 
      </p>
      <h3>Passage 2 </h3>

    <p>
      Imagine a world where children remain untouched by advertising. A utopian vision, perhaps, but one that would cripple our economic machinery. Marketing to children is akin to sowing seeds in fertile soil. These young minds, impressionable and curious, harbor the potential to blossom into discerning consumers. Brands recognize this and vie for their attention, not out of malevolence, but out of survival. 
      <br><br>


      Consider the humble cereal box. Its vibrant colors, playful mascots, and enticing promises beckon children during breakfast. Beneath the surface, however, lies a symbiotic relationship. The cereal company sustains itself, the child gains nourishment, and parents—often bleary-eyed—find solace in a quiet morning. Marketing bridges gaps, lubricating the wheels of commerce. 
      <br><br>


      Yet, the path to profit is strewn with ethical thorns. Herein lies the heart of the debate. Critics argue that marketing to children exploits their innocence, transforming them into unwitting brand ambassadors. The line blurs between education and indoctrination. When a sugary drink becomes synonymous with joy, when a toy’s logo eclipses imagination, we tread on delicate ground. 
      <br><br>


      Marketing to children, like a spider weaving its web, shapes society’s fabric. It mirrors our values, aspirations, and fears. Beneath the glossy billboards lie reflections of our collective psyche. We must ask: What do we value more—the purity of childhood or the engine of commerce? Perhaps the answer lies in balance. Responsible marketing can empower children, teaching critical thinking and media literacy. Brands can champion causes, instilling empathy and environmental consciousness. We need not choose between innocence and commerce; we can weave a tapestry that embraces both. 
      <br><br>


      So, let us tread this tightrope with care. For every ad that sparks wonder, let there be room for curiosity. For every branded lunchbox, let there be space for unscripted play. In this dance, we shape not just consumers but citizens—imbued with discernment, compassion, and the audacity to dream beyond logos.

        1. By referring to the writer's use of language, explain how it is made clear children are now active members in the world of marketing.(3 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	The writer's use of word choice in "not merely innocent bystanders" suggests children are now deeply involved in the advertising scene. "bystander" has connotations of spectator or observer, which signifies that now children are no longer outside the reach of marketers, but are within their grasp. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	In "they are active participants in the marketplace" word choice is used to demonstrate the large role that children play in the marketplace of today. "active" connotes involved, which depicts the commercial viability of children in marketing schemes. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The word choice in "their gaze has shifted toward the youngest members of society" highlights how children are now starting to being directly targeted by online marketers. "gaze" suggests focus or attention, which depicts how companies are now dedicating specific resources towards child advertising, making it clear that children are now active members in the world of marketing. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Any other reasonable response. 
        <br><br><br><br>


        2. Using your own words, summarize the main argument presented in paragraph 2 regarding the significance of children as consumers in the modern-day.(4 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	Paraphrasing of... 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"constitute a significant demographic for marketers", 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"They wield influence over their parents’ buying decisions", 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"and their substantial purchasing power extends beyond the candy aisle", 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"As family sizes shrink, dual incomes rise, and parents delay having children, disposable income flows more freely. The result? An army of pint-sized consumers ready to conquer the toy store, the cereal aisle, and the latest gadget display.". 
        <br><br><br><br>




        3. Refer to paragraph 3. Identify language techniques used by the writer to emphasise the impact of marketing on children's future purchasing habits.(4 marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	Word choice in "not just about immediate sales" emphasises the future potential that children have in the marketplace. "immediate" has connotations of now, or currently, which illustrates how marketers target children for the long game, so that when they grow older they will buy their products. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	In "children are future adult customers" word choice is used to demonstrate the marketers target towards prospects further down the line rather than ones that are happening right now. "future" connotes later, or time to come, which conveys the fact that marketing is aimed at children from a young age to shape their buying decisions at a later date. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The writer uses word choice in "young minds develop brand loyalty and purchasing habits early on" to display why marketers direct their focus on children from such a young age. "loyalty" suggests allegiance or devotion, and "habit" suggests without thinking or like second nature, which explains why child marketing schemes are so effective, and consequently why they can so easily they can manipulate their targets purchasing habits. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The imagery in "cementing their preferences for years to come" helps to express why children are targeted at such a young age. Just as cement dries very fast, and becomes extremely tough to shape or change, so too can children's beliefs and loyalties to brands be immovable and unchangeable when set from so early on. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The writer's use of word choice in "cultivating a partnership with young consumers becomes a strategic move" demonstrates the importance of forming a beneficial relationship with the younger consumers. "strategic" has connotations of beneficial or advantageous, which signifies why young people are often targeted by these marketing strategies. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Any other reasonable response 
        <br><br><br><br>




        4. In paragraph 4, summarize the authors main arguments against child marketing schemes.(3 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	Paraphrasing of... 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"Children under the age of 7 or 8 lack the cognitive ability to discern the persuasive intent of advertisements", 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"To them, commercials are not sales pitches; they are unfiltered truths", 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	"Exploiting this innocence for profit raises many ethical questions.". 
        <br><br><br><br>






        5. In paragraph 5, explain how the writer uses language to create a negative tone.(3 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	The word choice in "children internalize these materialistic values." helps to create a negative tone and continues the writer's argument against child marketing. "materialistic" has connotations of greedy or consumeristic, which highlights the damaging effect marketing to children has, giving the passage a negative tone. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The writer's use of word choice in "The pursuit of the next toy or gadget overshadows simpler joys like playing in the park or reading a book." displays the detrimental consequences that these marketing schemes are having. "overshadow" connotes diminish or upstage, which suggests children are now struggling to enjoy more elementary, mundane pleasures, which creates a negative and critical tone for the passage. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The authors use of a rhetorical question in "What does this say about our societal priorities in the modern day?" outlines the questionable practises of the advertisers. This helps to create a negative/critical tone around the topic of advertising to children. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Any other reasonable response 
        <br><br><br><br>






        6. How does the writer's use of language in paragraph 6 highlight the rising problem of children's diets?(4 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	The writer uses word choice in "shapes young children’s food preferences" to convey the strong influence marketing holds over the diets of children. "shapes" has connotations of change or alter, which outlines the problem with advertisers being able to target children, as they are easily moulded. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	In "Rising childhood obesity rates" word choice is used to demonstrate the increasing problem of overweight children, suggesting it is the result of advertising unhealthy food to children. "rising" connotes growing or escalating which conveys how the problem is only getting worse, and displays the harmful effect that child marketing has on the children. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The writer's use of word choice in "hooked on empty calories" emphasises the Un healthiness of the food being promoted, and also the strong dependence children now feel towards it. "hooked" suggests addicted or obsessed, which exhibits the dangers of allowing marketers to target children, and how it creates problems in their diets. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The rhetorical question in "Are we sacrificing our children’s health at the altar of profit?" highlights the dubious nature of advertising towards children. This exemplifies the destructive implications of the topic as a whole. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Any other reasonable response 
        <br><br><br><br>




        7. State how the writer's use of language in the conclusion effectively links back to the main argument as a whole.(4 Marks) 
        <br><br><br>
        ⦁	The writer uses imagery in "marketing to children is a tightrope walk" to depict the caution we must exert when dealing with children, and their indoctrination from advertisers . Just as at any moment you can fall off a tightrope, spiralling into an abyss below, so too can the safety of children dramatically decrease if we don't draw a line for these marketers. This links back to the main argument that in a perfect world, children should be more shielded from advertising. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Word choice in "safeguard childhood’s purity." conveys that measures should be put in place to protect children from marketing at such a young age. "safeguard" has connotations of shield or defend, which relates back to the central argument that children should not overrun with brand propaganda so early on in their lives. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	The rhetorical question in "What legacy are we leaving for the next generation? " emphasises the questionable nature of allowing advertisers to run free with no restrictions. This connects back to the main point in the passage that we should protect children more from malicious marketers trying to target them. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	In "they deserve more than just catchy jingles and colourful packaging" the use of word choice helps to support the idea that children should be more protected and less targeted from ignorant advertisers. "deserve" connotes to be worthy of or to merit, which conveys the writer's opinion that children should be entitled to more protection regarding advertising, which ties back to the main argument of the passage as a whole. 
        <br><br>
        ⦁	Any other reasonable response 
        <br><br><br><br>




        8.Look at both passages.
