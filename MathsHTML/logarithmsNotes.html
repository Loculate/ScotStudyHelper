    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Exponentials</h2>
    <p>Exponentials are an essential topic in the world of mathamatics. Being able to understand them can put you at a headstart in your exam, and earn you multiple marks if completed correctly
    An exponent represents how many times to use a base number in multiplication. For instance, in the expression (2^3), the base is 2, and it is used 3 times in multiplication: (2 times 2 times 2 = 8). <br><br> this will often pop up in an exam in the form "Something increases/decreases by something per something. If the starting amount is something, what will the amount of something be in something" <br><br>for instance, lets look at the example <br><br>"The amount of people in a city increases by 10% per year. If the starting population is 1000, what will
    the population be in 3 years"<br><br>"To complete a question like this, there are two methods, one requires time while the other is easier and quicker. The first method is finding the multiplier by doing 1 +/- the percentage divided by 100(+ or - depending on if it's increasing or decreasing), and then times the starting
     amount by the multiplier. The process is then repeated with the new amount for the amount of time given in the question, for instance, if it stated "In 3 years, we will repeat the process 3 times.". <br><br>Lets look at the previous example, if the poulation increases by 10% each year, we add 0.1 to 1, giving us
    a multiplier of 1.1, then we times this by 1000(The starting population) and repeat for 3 years.<br><br>Year 1 - 1000 * 1.1 = 1100<br>Year 2 - 1100 * 1.1 = 1210<br>Year 3 - 1210 * 1.1 = 1331<br><br>The second, and more simple method, is taking the muiltiplier and raising it to the power of the time given(So for 3 years
    multiplier to the power of 3), which we can then times by the starting population to get the final answer.<br><br>1000 * 1.1^3 = 1331</p>

    <h2>Logarithms</h2>
    <p>Logarithms are a larger part of the exam for higher, and will typically appear in the non-calculator paper, and on rare occasions also the calculator paper. A logarithm answers the question: How many of one number multiply together to make another number? For example, log(3)9  = 2, because 3 multiplied
    by itself twice gives us 9. Logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation. They “undo” the effect of exponentials. If you have an exponential equation like (b^y = x), the logarithm helps you find the value of (y). For instance, if you want to solve (2^y = 8), you can use the logarithm to find that (y = 3), because 2 is multiplied by itself
    3 times to reach 8.<br><br>To add and subtract logarithms together, we must take a slightly different approach because since something like log(2)2 is 1 and log(2)4 = 2, it can be said that 2 = log(2)2 + log(2)2, meaning log(2)4 = log(2)2 log(2)2. This clearly demonstrates that when we want to add logarithms together, we must multiply them, for example log(2)2 + log(2)4
    must be log(2)8. Note that we can only add or subtract logarithms together when the share a base(In this intance 2), otherwise they cannot, for instance log(5)2 + log(6)3 cannot be calculated without a calculator. <br><br>Lets look at the example below, combining all our previous knowledge:<br><br>Log(2)4 + log(2)2<br><br>Since the bases are the same,
    we can begin by multipling them together to get "Log(2)8", and now we can see that 2 cubed(To the power of 3) equals the value  "8", which gives us an answer of 3.<br><br>Subtracting logs is identical to adding them, only instead of multiplying them we divide them. Lets once again look at the previous example, only tjhis time it's
      <br><br>Log(2)4 - log(2)2<br><br>We can start by dividing 4 by 2 ,since the bases are the same, to get Log(2)2. Since 2 multiplies by itself once to get 2, the answer is simply 1.</p>
