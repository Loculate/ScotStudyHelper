    <h2 style="margin-top: 5%;">Composite Functions</h2>
      <p>Composite functions are questions where you are asked to solve a function within a function, and will typically appear in the non-calulator paper. When done correctly, these questions can be an easy three marks,
        all that is needed to do is subsitute one function in place of x in the other. <br><br>For example, "Functions f and g are defined on a suitable domain by f(x) = x^2 + 3 and g(x) = x + 1. Find and expression for h(x), which = f(g(x))"<br><br>The
        first step is to sub in g(x) so we get f(x+1). Next, we can continue as we would with a normal function and h(x) = (x + 1)^2 + 3,(Since in this case "x" = (x + 1) and f(x) = x^2 + 3). <br><br><br>Now we can multiply out the bracket to get
        the final answer of x^2 + 2x + 4.
    </p>

      <h2>Inverse Functions</h2>
          <p>The main idea of an inverse function is to do the exact opposite of what the original function does. So if f(x) = 2x, which doubles a value, f^-1(x) = 0.5x, which halves a value.<br><br>To figure out the inverse of a function, the first step is to change f(x) for y,
            for example, f(x) = 3x - 1 changes to y = 3x- 1. <br><br>Next, we must change the subject of the function to x, which we can do simply by adding one to both sides then dividing by 3 to get x = y/3 + 1/3. <br><br>The last step, is to again change the x back to f^-1(x), and the y to x. This leaves us with
            a final answer of f^-1(x) = x/3 + 1/3.
