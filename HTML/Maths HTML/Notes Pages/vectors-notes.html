          <p class = "section-information">In mathematics, collinearity is a term used to describe certain types of points. For points to be colinear they must meet two criteria, <br><br>1. They must be parallel, which means they
            are multiples of the same vector, for example vectors i and 2i are parallel.<br><br>2. They must also share a common point.<br><br>Lets look at the example below, commonly a question will ask you to prove wether points are or are not colinear,
            for example "Since A(-2, -2), B(0, 0), C(4, 4)  Prove that the vectors AB and BC are colinear" <br><br>The first step is to find vecors AB and BC, which we can do by using AB = b - a and BC = c - b. Now we have both vectors, and we can see that 2AB = BC(Since
            BC is two times bigger, and therefore we need two AB to equal one BC). <br><br>The last step is to state that the points are colinear, for instance, <br><br>• As 2AB = BC, the vectors are parallel.<br><br>• As they also share a common point, they are colinear."</p>

          <p class = "section-information">Line ratios are closely related to collinearity, in that we also must find the difference in size between two vectors.<br><br>Once we have the difference in size we can then figure out some other information using algebra.<br><br> For example lets look
            at the question below using using the same points as last time, but this time without the point b.<br><br>"Since its known that A(-2, -2), C(4, 4) and B divides the two points in the ratio 1:2, find the coordinates of b"<br><br>"We can first begin by setting out equation to 2AB = BC, (Since
            we know that BC is two times bigger, we need two AB to equal it out.).<br><br>The next step is to simplify to the equation 2(b - a) = (c - b), and then 3b = c + 2a.<br><br>The last step is to sub in our points and then divide by 3 to get out point b, which is (0, 0).</p>

          <p class = "section-information">The lasts section of vectors is when you may be asked to find the angle between vectors, and can be found using the formula a.b = │a│ * │b│ * Cos(θ).<br><br>These will appear mostly on calculator papers but also occasionally on non-calculator papers, and are relatively simple. Lets look at the example below:<br><br>
            "Find the angle between vectors A(3, 4) and B(-2, 5)"<br><br>"Since we need both the magnitudes and dot product of the vectors, we can calculate the dot product from a.b = (3 * -2) + (4 * 5), and hence a.b = 14<br><br>To find the magnitudes, we can use │a│ = √((3)² + (4)²), and │b│ = √((-2)² + (5)²), and so │a│ = 5, and │b│ = √29.<br><br>The final step
            is to put all of this information into he aforementioned formula to get θ = Cos⁻¹(14/5√29), and therefore θ = 59°.</p>
