          <p class = "section-information">Exact values are an integral part of trigonometry, and appear in the non-calculator paper, where they will ask you to calculate the value of an angle, for example, "find the exact value of
            Cos(120)". To start solving the question, we must first find the equivalent in the first sector of the graph. Both sin and cos graphs can be split into 4 equal areas, and depending on the area and the graph, depends if the number will
            be positive or negative. For example, the sin graph is positive in both the first and second quadrant, while the cos graph is positive in the first and last. The easiest way to figure out which quadrant is positive and negative, is to simply
            draw the graph. <br><br>In the previously mentioned instance, since "120" lies in the second quadrant(between 90 and 180) and because the cos graph in negative in the second area, our answer will be negative. Now we know if the value is positive or negative, we
            must find the same angle in the first section, which we can do by again looking at the graph, which shows us that if we go 60 degrees back, we will reach the same point but on the first sector,which is at the 60 degree mark. The final part of the question, is figuring
            out what cos(60) is(since now we know that cos(120) will be the value of cos(60) but negative), which we can do simply by looking at the exact value triangle, or value table(depending on which way you learned it). From this we can see that cos(60) = 1/2, and consequently, cos(120) = -1/2.

          <p class = "section-information">In mathematics, compound angles are the addition of two angles within a Cosine or Sine, for example "What is the value of Cos(p + q)"", and then values or two triangles will be given to find Sin(p), Cos(p), Sin(q) and Cos(q), which is the first step to solving these
            types of questions(I used p and q as an example here but in reality it could be any letters). <br><br>If the values are given straight away, then we can skip to the next stage, however if they are in a triangle, a little extra effort is required. To find these, we can look at the angles on the triangle and then match
            up the sides with the equations for cos and sin(opposite over hypotenuse and adjacent over hypotenuse respectively). For example, to find "Sin(q)", we would look at the opposite side from angle q, and the hypotenuse to get our value. Repeat for all values necessary and then we can move onto the next step.<br><br>
            The next step, is to look at our formula sheet and select the right equation from it(There are two equations one for Cos and one for Sin), then, subsitute the values we found before into the equation, and simplify to get the final answer.
