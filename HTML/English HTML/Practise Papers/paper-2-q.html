      <h3 style="margin-top: 5%;">Passage 1</h3>
    <p>
      Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, enshrined in the constitutions of many nations. It is the cornerstone of democratic societies, fostering open dialogue, promoting intellectual growth, and facilitating societal progress. College campuses, as microcosms of society, are no exception to this rule. 
      <br><br>


      In recent years, however, the sanctity of free speech on college campuses has come under scrutiny. Instances of speech censorship, safe spaces, and disinvitation of controversial speakers have sparked heated debates about the limits of free speech in these supposed bastions of intellectual freedom. 
      <br><br>


      On one hand, proponents of unrestricted free speech argue that college campuses should be arenas for open dialogue, where ideas can be freely exchanged, scrutinized, and either accepted or refuted. They contend that shielding students from controversial or offensive ideas does not prepare them for the real world, where such ideas are commonplace. They believe that the essence of higher education lies in challenging existing beliefs and encouraging critical thinking. In their view, any form of censorship, no matter how well-intentioned, stifles this intellectual growth. 
      <br><br>


      On the other hand, advocates for speech regulation argue that certain forms of speech can create a hostile environment for marginalized groups, thereby infringing on their right to a safe and inclusive educational experience. They assert that colleges have a duty to protect their students from harm, even if it means imposing certain restrictions on speech. They argue that freedom of speech should not be used as a shield for hate speech or discrimination, and that colleges should strive to create an environment where all students feel valued and respected. 
      <br><br>


      This dichotomy mirrors larger societal debates about the balance between individual rights and collective welfare. Just as society grapples with the tension between freedom and security, so too do college campuses struggle to reconcile the right to free speech with the need for inclusivity. This tension is further exacerbated by the rise of social media, which has amplified the reach and impact of speech, blurring the lines between public and private discourse. 
      <br><br>


      In conclusion, the debate over freedom of speech on college campuses is a reflection of broader societal tensions. It is a complex issue with no easy solutions. However, it is precisely through engaging with such complexities that society can hope to progress. As we navigate this issue, it is crucial to remember that the goal should not be to silence dissenting voices, but to foster a culture of respect and understanding, and create an environment where diverse perspectives can coexist and enrich our collective discourse.

      <h3>Passage 2 </h3>

    <p>
      Freedom of speech is a fundamental right, deeply rooted in the democratic ethos of many nations. It is the lifeblood of intellectual discourse and the cornerstone of societal progress. However, it is not an absolute right, and in certain contexts, it must be balanced against other considerations. One such context is the college campus, a microcosm of society, where the need to maintain a safe and inclusive environment is paramount. 
      <br><br>


      In recent years, the issue of unrestricted free speech on college campuses has come to the fore. While the principle of free speech is undeniably important, its unfettered application can lead to the propagation of harmful narratives. These narratives, often rooted in prejudice and misinformation, can create a hostile environment for marginalized groups. This infringes on their right to a safe and inclusive educational experience, a right that is equally as important as the right to free speech. 
      <br><br>


      Colleges and universities have a duty to protect their students from such harm. This duty extends beyond the physical safety of students to include their psychological and emotional well-being. In this regard, colleges must set boundaries on speech that is harmful or offensive. This is not about stifling intellectual growth or debate, but rather about ensuring that all students, regardless of their background or identity, can participate in these debates without fear of harassment or discrimination. 
      <br><br>


      The challenge, of course, lies in determining where these boundaries should be set. Too restrictive, and the risk is a stifling of free speech and intellectual growth. Too lax, and the risk is a hostile and unsafe environment for certain groups of students. It is a delicate balance that colleges must navigate, often in the face of intense scrutiny and criticism. 
      <br><br>


      In conclusion, while the freedom of speech is a fundamental right and a cornerstone of intellectual discourse, it is not absolute. On college campuses, it must be balanced against the need to maintain a safe and inclusive environment. This is a complex and nuanced issue, but it is one that colleges must tackle head-on, for the sake of their students and for the sake of intellectual growth and societal progress.
