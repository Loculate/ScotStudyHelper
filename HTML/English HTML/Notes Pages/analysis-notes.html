          <p class = "section-information">Analysis questions appear both on RUAE papers, and critical reading papers, which means it is imperative to master key techniques that will alllow us excell, no matter the situation.<br>
            <br>Most questions of this nature will use language similar to "analyse how the writer's language..." to hint that this may be an analysis question, for example, from the 2023 paper, an analysis question asks
          "By referring to at least two examples, analyse how the writer’s language suggests that popular film characters are damaged by prequels and sequels.". <br><br>These types of questions can easily be overcome by
          using the simple formula: <br><br>W ord Choice<br>I magery<br>T one<br>S entence Structure</p>

        <div class = "section-right-container">
          <p class = "section-information">We will start by breaking apart each technique and analysising how we can maximise the chance to gain a
            mark. <br><br>Word Choice can be defined as the words the writer is using, and what associations those words contain. The word "Connotations" is commonly used, which simply refers to what a word make you think
            of, and how it makes you feel. For example, sticking to the previous example, we can take the quote "Buffoon" which we can see has negative connotations, it puts a beloved character(Darth Vader in this example)
             and uses a word connected to stupidity, and unintelligence, to demonstrate the writers disaproval of the character assination. To start, you need to find an appropriate quote, then state the effect it has. Next we will
            state the connotations the quoted word has, and then link our answer back to the question.For example we could answer the previously stated question by writing... <br><br>Word choice used in "buffon" depicts the
            writers clear distain for the damage done to Darth Vader's character. "buffoon" has connotations of idiot or imbecile, which outlines the writer's opinion that prequels damage popular film characters</p>

        <div class = "section-right-container">
          <p class = "section-information">The next language technique we will look at is Imagery, which can be summed up as the correlation between two things, and why the writer has compared them together. For example, in the 2023 higher paper, the writer states
            "plodding parade of films" to highlight the overcrowded and overproduced nature of prequels. By comparing the market of prequels to an obnoxious parade, it makes the reader associate those emotions and feelings with the
            prequels themselves. To answer questions related to Imagery, we can use the simple formula "Just as ... so to does...". For example, using the previous quote we could say... <br><br> Imagery used in "
            plodding parade of films" to accentuate the uneeded, and overcrowded space of prequels. Just as a parade is obnoxious, and crammed, so too is the market for prequels saturated, and overflowing.</p>

          <h4>Tone</h4>

        </div>

        <div class = "section-right-container">
          <p class = "section-information">The language technique of tone is little more subtle, and takes more skill to pinpoint, but definitely still creates viable answers. Tone is the way an author creates a certain attitude or feeling in their writing using language techniques,
            for example in the paper we previously looked at, the writer creates a comedic tone in "Now bear with me, but have we, possibly, maybe — and I do not want to be judgemental — entirely run out of ideas?" to explain the
            absurdity of creating several identical movies. To answer this type of question, we need to first find a quote, and identify what type of attitude the writer wants to express. This could be several, such as comedic, sarcastic,
           critical, ironic, and many more. Then you will say how the writer achieves this, and what effect it produces. Using the previous example we could say ...<br><br>The comedic tone in "Now bear with me, but have we, possibly,
           maybe — and I do not want to be judgemental — entirely run out of ideas?" is achieved through excessive use of parenthesis, and hesitating. This supports the theme of the writer's disaproval of prequel, and emphasises the ridiculousness
           of producing 8 movies of the same franchise. </p>

            <h4>Sentence Structure</h4>

          </div>

          <div class = "section-right-container">
            <p class = "section-information">The final technique used is sentence stucture, which is the manner in which an author uses punctuation to outline a point or key idea. For example, in the 2023 paper, the
              parenthesis in "If — and it’s a big if —" is utilized to demonstrate the lack of need for prequels. We can begin answering these types of questions by identifying a quote, and figuring out what type of sentence stucture is
               used. Then you need to explain why this creates the desired effect on the viewer. For example, going back to the 2023 paper we can see...<br><br>In "The third new one in 16 years.", a short, dramatic sentence is used to
               unveil the gigantic lack in recent creativity in the film market. This leaves the viewer with a powerful, lasting impression on the dullness of the film market.</p>
