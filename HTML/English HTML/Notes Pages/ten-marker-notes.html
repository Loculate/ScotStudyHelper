              <p class = "section-information">The ten marker will appear only in the critical
                reading section of the exam, however it is worth 25% of that paper, so it is very important to practice it.
                To answer 10 marker questions, we can use the simple formula: <br><br>Commonality (2 Marks)<br>This Extract/Poem(2 Marks)
                 <br>Other Extract/Poem(6 Marks)
                <br>
                <br>
                To begin the 10 marker, we start with commonality, which is linking the current Poem/Extract
         to another that you have learned. You will need to try and think of another poem/extract which is closely related to the
        question at hand, for example it may ask us to discuss "How does the writer use contrast to explore central concerns", in which cases we would want
        to use a poem/extract where this is well demonstrated.<br><br>Once we have selected an appropriate poem/extract, we will state how that
        effect links to the poem/extract infront of you, and the other one that you decided on. Then we will explain how the poem/extract
        achieves this effect through is language techniques. Here is an example below:<br><br>In Assisi by Norman Maccaig, the contrast between
        the luxurious church and the abandoned beggar is used to explore the central concern of the hypocrisy of the church.</p>

              <p class = "section-information">The second part of the question, worth 2 marks, is the part where we analyse the use of language from
                the poem/extract given to you, and then link it back to the question being asked. If you are unsure how achieve this, make sure to review the
                "Analysis Page" in the previous page.</p>

                solely of memory. You will have to use at least one quote from the selected poem/extract stated earlier and analyse the writer's use of language, just as before,
                however this time you will have to remember the quotes as they will not be infront of you. </p>
